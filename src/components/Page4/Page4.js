                So Guillaume waited 'til Nanna napped
                To begin his Journey to NÃ­ce.
                He nabbed his nephew's knitted knickers,
                Bought a new gnu named Hugh,
                And knotted his knapsack
                To a notch near his navel.
            </p>
        </div>
    )
