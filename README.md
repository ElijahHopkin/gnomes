# Every Gnome Knows

# For the masses: a fun story about a gnome, and a great opportunity to learn words with silent 'G's and 'K's.
Every Gnome knows is intended to be flagrantly complicated for most English speaker's vocabulary, but it utilizes alliteration to present complicated vocabulary in an interesting way.
This story is meant to teach silent G's and K's after the manner of Dr. Seuss--through comical word-play.

It is based in German folk-lore and features Gnomes and a Kobold--which were related creatures.
